## TypeScript Standard Library

This is a TypeScript library designed to be used as a foundation for projects by providing building blocks (modules). It's goal is to _not_ force you to use it throughout the project and it also doesn't want you to be forced to solve something in a specific way. Instead it tries to solve isolated problems with the modules which you can put together as you wish and use independently.

In addtion to the modules it also provides many utilities.
